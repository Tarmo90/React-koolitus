By framing our LTF structure off of HTF levels, we are no longer afraid of retracements in the market, rather, we look at these retracements as opportunities to add to our positions.",

The Opening Prices that you will be paying attention to are: Weekly Open: Monday 18:00 EST Open Price Daily Open: 00:00 EST Open Price (Midnight Opening Price) We can refer to these price levels as time based Premium & Discount. If bullish, it is ideal to enter longs below the Opening Price. Vice versa, if bearish, it is ideal to enter shorts above the Opening Price.",
